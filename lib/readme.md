# Thoughts

* Be careful about code splitting concerns
  * e.g. don't mix up dependencies needlessly
* is there a curried function inline tool?

* Sanctuary/FL interop via dedicated helper
  * e.g. types, hybrid types, FL types
  * hybrid can check both

* Modularity - how to divvy things up?

* how far can we go with "native" constructs?
* look at Meteor Check and Meteor Match code
